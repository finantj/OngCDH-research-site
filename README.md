# OngCDH Research Site

Static marketing and repository landing page for the Walter J. Ong, S.J. Center for Digital Humanities at Saint Louis University.

## Getting started

1. Open `index.html` in your browser to view the site locally. No build step is required.
2. All styles live in `assets/css/main.css` and client-side behavior in `assets/js/app.js`.
3. Project and white paper listings are curated inside `assets/js/app.js`. Update the `PROJECTS` and `WHITE_PAPERS` arrays to feature additional work or change links to hosted assets.

## Brand alignment

- Color palette follows SLU brand guidance (SLU Blue, deep navy, neutral grays, accent red).
- Typeface pairing uses Montserrat and Source Serif as accessible web alternatives to SLU&rsquo;s Proxima Nova and Mercury families.
- Custom SVG shield and geometric background evoke university identity without relying on WordPress themes.

## Accessibility & responsiveness

- Semantic HTML structure with landmark elements and accessible navigation controls.
- Responsive layout using CSS grid/flexbox and mobile navigation toggle.
- Searchable white paper list and filterable project grid for quick discovery.
